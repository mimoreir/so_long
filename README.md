# so_long

Grade: 110%

so_long is a 2D game using C and the mlx library.
It was very fun to do, I made my own graphics with pixel art.
To play first go to the mlx folder and use ./configure, then go to the main folder and use make.
usage: ./so_long maps/[choose one valid map] you can do your own map, the extension of a valid map is .ber.
